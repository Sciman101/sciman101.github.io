  subtitle: Secret Santa Gamejam 2020, Godot 3.2
  type: game
  date: 2020-12-20
  description: A momentum-based platformer where the player can grapple and swing from a vine. Developed over the course of a month, with a lot of care being put into the grappling mechanic and the sound design - the latter something I normally struggle with. Easily one of the better games I've made.

  type: game
  date: 2020-11-01
  description: "A hugely ambitious pixel platform fighter based around [characters](/characters.html) I designed. Built for local multiplayer with all major code and animation done by myself. In the end it was put on hold due to scope issues and not being super fun to play, but it still stands as one of the biggest things I've ever worked on. One day, I'll finally finish it"

  description: A 'remake' of a very old project I made to learn the basics of Gamemaker. First time working with targeting a mobile device, which was made easier by borrowing some ui inspirations from Downwell. See how far down you can go!

- name: ANYKEY
  subtitle: Party Game, Unity
  type: game
  date: 2018-01-13
  description: What started as an experiment to practice Unity ended up becoming my first release on Steam. ANYKEY was less about mechanical depth - the main mechanic only uses a single button - and more about figuring out how to *finish* something. Grab a friend or a dozen, huddle around a keyboard, and give it a spin.

  description: A mod to let you write and execute Brainf*ck code in Minecraft. Ridiculous? Yeah. Useful? ...maybe. It was a fun challenge to implement, and involved combining both a Minecraft mod and a simple language interpreter.
