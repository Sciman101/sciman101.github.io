# Spotlight
Every month, I'll be adding new projects here my friends have been working on that I think deserve recognition. These could be games, artwork, music - whatever they happen to be doing. Check them out!

## September 2021 - Heck Deck
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606210/header.jpg">
[Heck Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1606210/Heck_Deck/) by torcado is a rougelite bullet hell card game. It's a weird combination of gernes, originally inspired by the [41st Ludum Dare](https://torcado.com/LD41/HTML5/). It's since been expanded into a mobile and pc release with several stages, more cards, multiple languages, and a shine of polish that comes with the kind of work torcado is known for. It releases soon, but there's a demo available for download right now!

## August 2021 - Bops

[Bops](http://www.queenjazz.gay/bops/) by queenjazz is an album full of energetic, poppy, electronic tunes. The songs range from uplifting jams where text-to-speech voices sing about moving beyond past struggles to aggresive, pounding beats about.. demons, I think? Make sure to give her previous album, [Bangers](https://queenjazz.bandcamp.com/album/bangers), a listen once you're done.
