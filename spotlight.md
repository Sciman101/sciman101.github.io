Every month, I'll be adding new projects here my friends have been working on that I think deserve recognition. These could be games, artwork, music - whatever they happen to be doing. Check them out!

[Bops](http://www.queenjazz.gay/bops/) by queenjazz is an album full of energetic, poppy, electronic tunes. The songs range from uplifting jams where text-to-speech voices sing about moving beyond past struggles to aggresive, pounding beats about.. demons, I think? Make sure to give her previous album, [Bangers](https://queenjazz.bandcamp.com/album/bangers), a listen once you're done.
