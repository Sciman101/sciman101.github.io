<h2 id="backstory"><a href="#backstory">Backstory</a></h2>
<p>Root was created by a family of 3 parent kobolds, alongside 3 other siblings (yet to be named). Their family had a fairly low income, however was able to live a generally happy life. Root in particular took after their 'father', who instilled a love of books and writing in them at a young age. He, however, was the oldest member of the family and was unable to afford life extensions, passing when Root was still young. Though his death was peaceful, Root was upset that he had been denied as full a life as other kobolds due to their economic status, and became determined to find a way to produce cheaper life extenders for kobold-kind.</p>
<p>To this end, they were one of two of their siblings to go to an academy, where they studied biological alchemy with the hopes of going into medicine. This was really when their workaholic tendencies came into full effect. They became antisocial, devoting themselves so fully to their study as to forget about pretty much everything else. They had a habit of skipping meals and generally ignoring their well being, sleeping infrequently and restlessly. If it weren't for a roommate of theirs, Darue, keeping a watchful eye on them, Root likely would have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Root graduated top of their class and absolutely miserable. At the request of their family and Darue, they avoided going straight into the medical world and took a bit of a break for themselves. They moved to Magnolia, got a kobold-sized apartment, and took up a job at a donut store while they started going to therapy. They were able to recognize a lot of their self-destructive habits through their sessions, and slowly managed to build up more of a social life and - despite not doing anything they would deem <em>important</em> - ended up much happier. They also allowed themselves to eat and enjoy themselves more, leading to them putting on a bit of weight. Initially apprehensive about it, they eventually took it as a good thing and grew accustomed to it. They also reconnected with Darue, meeting some of their friends through them and being welcomed into their social circle. With some of their newfound free time, Root got back into literature and started writing with her father's old typewriter.</p>
<p>During this 'break', Root also started becoming more aware of the homeless population of Magnolia, and some of the efforts being made by the town to reduce their visibility. When they became aware of benches designed specifically to make sleeping across them more difficult, they felt an anger similar to when they first learned about the price of life extenders, bought an enchanted crowbar, and started vandalizing them to make them more habitable. They also began stealing unsold food from the store they worked at. It was thrown out at the end of the day, anyways, and Root figured it would better serve people who had limited access to food, anyways. Even if it was mostly sugary pastries.</p>
<p>Reinvigorated by a sense of justice, Root continued their small acts of vigilantism, going solo as to avoid getting anyone else in trouble. They once again had something to sink themselves into, that could bring some good to the world. Whether or not they would fall back into their self-destructive habits, though, was something else entirely.</p>
<h2 id="character"><a href="#character">Character</a></h2>
<p>Root is laid back, friendly, and carries with them a strong hatred of injustice. From birth they've wanted to do everything in their power to help those in need, sometimes to their own detriment.
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Root is well aware of their tendency to bury themselves so deeply in their projects that they forget about the outside world, and themselves.</p>
<p>When not stuck in this self-destructive path, though, Root tends to be one of the more level-headed, easygoing members of the group. They're frequently willing to help, and tend to be the first to lend an ear to listen to the problems of others.</p>
<p>Despite the intense burnout they felt post-graduation, Root still has a fascination with alchemy and chemistry, and hopes to continue pursuing it someday.</p>
<h2 id="trivia"><a href="#trivia">Trivia</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Root previously went by Tau (They/Them), but changed it shortly after graduation.</li>
<li>Root's 'Taxi Pants' are a custom creation made by dying/painting a pair of white jeans.</li>
<li>Root has a strong sweet tooth and loves sugary foods, especially pastries - this is a big reason why they ended up working at the donut shop.</li>
<li>Root's typewriter was inherited from their late father. It's enchanted to never run out of ink.</li>
<li>Root refuses to wear shoes and insists being barefoot is healthier.</li>
<li>Root can eat an entire donut in one bite. Everyone hates it when he does this.</li>
