# About

Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Sciman101** - New England based programmer and artist (and student, for now). I like making projects with a lot of character and appeal - hopefully they're good, maybe not, but at the very least they're pretty interesting.

This site serves as a little corner of the internet for me to show off my own art and projects, promote my friends, and maybe say a few things here and there.
