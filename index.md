# About

Hey, thanks for stopping by! I'm **Yali** - New England based programmer, artist, and game developer (and, for the time being, student). I specialize in making what I like to think of as interesting, self-contained ideas with a lot of character. The kinds of things someone might give you a kind of sideways, mildly concerned glance for. That's me!

This site serves as a way to link together a bunch of my social accounts, show off my work, and host little web-based experiments I need a place to put.

There's not much here right now, I'm still in the process of putting everything together.

This site was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source is available [here](https://github.com/Sciman101/sciman101.github.io) on my GitHub.
