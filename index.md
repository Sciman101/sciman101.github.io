description: Sciman101's personal site

Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Sciman101** - artist, programmer, and tinkerer, currently working as a software engineer. This site serves as a volatile little corner of the internet for me to show off my own [art](/art.html) and [projects](/projects.html), and to [promote my friends](/spotlight.html).

I'm planning on redoing some of this site in the future - nothing huge, but I want to clean things up and get some stuff up to date. Expect changes in `NaN` days!
