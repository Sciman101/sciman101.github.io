title: Building a 3d printer
---
For some reason, I got bit by the 3d printing bug a few months back.

I always thought the tech was cool - The first time I saw one was in the Discovery show *Prototype This*, some industrial SLS machine. Not too long after, I was getting one at a Maker Faire in sometime around 2014. It was a Printrbot Simple, back when hobby-grade 3d printers were made of laser cut plywood and barely worked. Then, I kind of forgot about the whole thing, and did other things for a couple years.

Cut ahead to now, and the 3d printer landscape is a little different. I needed an on-campus job, and worked at my school's 3d printer lab for a few months, remembering that old interest in the tech. It was a tiny room with a couple Prusas (nice) and Makerbots (not nice).

After working at there for a few months, I took the dive and bought myself an Ender 3 v2. It was a pain in the ass to get working, takes constant tweaking, but it only cost 200$ and I'm honestly pretty happy with it. That said, I don't use it *that* much. When I need it, it's great! Otherwise, it just sits on my table, waiting for the next time I need a specific plastic doodad. And, honestly, most of the things I ended up printing for it were just parts for it. 3d printing is a kind of oroborous of a hobby.
