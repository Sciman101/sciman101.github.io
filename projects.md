## Tussle Punks
### 2018 - 2020, On Hold
### Godot 3.2
Tussle Punks is a local multiplayer platform fighter based on [a bunch of characters](/characters.html) I made. Each character has a completely unique moveset, with the goal of having each character feel almost like they came from a totally different platformer game, but for them to still work together as a cohesive whole. It's my most ambitious project to date - which is probably why I've been working on it for 2 years.

## Raccoon Revenge
### MassDIGI Summer Innovation Program
### 2020
### Unity
Raccoon Revenge is a game I made during the _2020 MassDIGI Summer Innovation Program_. You play as Snatcher, a raccoon theif, trying to steal back your garbage in a top-down stealth environment. I was responsible for most of the core mechanics programming, some UI work, and some graphics here and there.

## #DrawingADay
### January 2020 - August 2020
For 2020, I decided I was going to make at least one drawing every day. Not the best year I could have picked, but I stuck to it - until I got a repetitive stress injury sometime in August. Whoops. I managed to get 205/366 drawings done, isn't too bad. You can check out every drawing in reverse order [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3ASciman101%20%23DrawingADay&src=typed_query&f=live).

## Just Dig Down
### 2018
### Gamemaker Studio 1.4
Just Dig Down is a remake of an old unfinished project, creatively titled 'Dig.gmx'. In both games, you dig down endlessly, harvesting rare gems and minerals to rack up a highscore while avoiding subterranean hazards. The newer version has mobile support, much nicer graphics, sounds, and a nice layer of polish. For my first mobile game, it came out pretty well.

## ANYKEY
### 2018
### Unity
ANYKEY started as a Unity test project, that eventually ended up being my first game published on Steam. Designed as a sort of party game version of a simple mobile game mechanic, you control a small spinning circle, holding down your respective key to spin, and releasing to continue straight. The goal is to avoid running into the border, and complete as many loops as possible. By far my most successful game.
