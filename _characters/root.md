**Root** just wants to vibe. With their resting tired face and punk/ska outfit (taxi pants?), people tend to assume they're on the abrasive side, but that couldn't be further from the truth. When the oppritunity arises, they're the type to try and start conversations, get to know people, see how they can help. They have a very strong reaction to injustice, and go out of their way to try and help the people they find in need, through what limited means they have. They aren't much of a fighter and tend to avoid being in the thick of it, instead being support from the sidelines.

On their own, they keep to themselves. Root, again, just wants to chill and prioritize themselves, something they're still learning to do. 

## Background
Root spent their early life constantly pushing themself and working to meet not only their own expectations, but those of others. This came to a head when they went to school to study Alchemy & Chemistry, an already intense program that wasn't made easier by Root's unrealistic expectations of themself. They threw themselves into their studies, and in the process ended up missing out on much of a social life, sometimes skipping meals in the name of working hard. They came out the other end with a very impressive certificate in alchemy, and the realization that maybe they weren't taking care of themselves.

After taking some time to re-evaluate their decisions, they decided to take a break from anything to do with alchemy and took a job at a local donut shop. It paid well enough, the hours lined up with their nearly nocturnal sleeping schedule, and Root had a soft spot for patries and coffee.

One evening, closing up, Root was told to take all the unsold inventory and... throw it out. They couldn't sell it the next day due to some weird health reasons, and they couldn't eat 100 donuts in a night. They brought up the idea of giving them out to the local homeless population, something they'd been increasingly aware of thanks to the urban location of the shop, but they weren't allowed to for... some reason. Root wasn't really paying attention, the second they heard 'No,', they'd stopped listening to their boss and started plotting on how to best sneak out and redistribute all the leftovers undetected. Their desire to help those in need only grew from there.

## Trivia
 - Root writes in their free time, and has a handful of short stories and WIPs under their belt
 - Being a Procyon Kobold, Root can turn themselves invisible, save for their eyes. This helps considerably with their donut espionage
 - After starting the whole donut-redistribution thing, Root started becoming more aware of other issues facing the people they were trying to help - like spiked plates built into the exterior of buildings, so it would be impossible to sleep there
	- They also bought an enchanted crowbar around this time... no reason, or anything
- Root is aromantic
- Root figured out how to fit an entire donut in their mouth and eat it in one bite, which makes everyone else viscerally uncomfortable
