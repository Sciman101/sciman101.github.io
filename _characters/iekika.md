**Iekika** is an imp - a species of reclusive psychics from an isolated island chain. Previously a prophet, always energetic, Iekika is known for her hyper attitude and lack of foresight. She worries about the future, but doesn't necessarily know how to *plan* for it. Thank god she's a good improviser.

It's rare to see Iekika sitting still. She's always got a foot claw bobbing up and down, hands fidgeting with her spear (which never seems to leave her side), or just pacing back and forth. And that's when she's trying *not* to move. In terms of athletics, she's shockingly capable. She can outrun, climb, and fight most people she comes across. And she fights anyone who'll let her - she sees it as a kind of sport.

She has a deep desire to have ‘her thing’ - whether that be her place in society, her role in the friend group, her hobby, etc etc, she never feels content just wandering.

## Background
Iekika lived with her fellow imps on Paradise Isles, a sentient island chain that they all worked to keep hidden from the outside world. The island had blessed her with the rare gift of clairvoyance - it would commune with her, sending her visions of the future. As her island's prophet, she was able to bring prosperity to her people.

Aside from that, she trained as a hunter. Though her real passion was in fighting other imps recreationally, something she got to channel with her then partner, [Makana](/characters/makana.html), one of the only imps who could take her 1 on 1. Life was good.

Then one day, she was struck with a vision - a hurricane, the likes of which had never been seen by impkind, would come at nightfall and threaten to destroy her home. The issue was, one of the nearby islands didn't have a prophet, and might not realize the storm was approaching until it was too late. Despite the other's protests, Iekika took a boat and set off to warn the others - before she was caught by the very storm she had foreseen, and thrown overboard.

When she came to, she wasn't on the islands anymore - nowhere near it. She had washed up on the mainland, and had attracted the attention of a [weird, 2-eyed creature](/characters/amber.html). After accidentally clobbering the human out of surprise and taking some time to adjust, she’s trying her best to accomodate to life among these weird binocular creatures. Their food is good, at least.
