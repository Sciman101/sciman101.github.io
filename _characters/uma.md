**Uma Slimebutt** is on a perpetual contact high with life. Her needs are simple - good food, nice friends, fun times - but she wants as much of them as she can get. Too much is never enough, and being a self-proclaimed hedonist she knows this better than most. All that said, she's not selfish. She's more than willing to share with people who need something more than her, or just want it. But when she can, she'll take all she can get.

When it comes to her appearance, she puts a care and effort into it, making sure to shape her body just so to look how she wants it. It would be a lot easier for her to be a shapeless blob, and take a lot less effort on her part, but Uma has someting of a weird fascination with humans, and tries her hardest to pass as one, if only through her mannerisms. Some might try and call her out on it, but it takes a lot to rattle her seemingly endless confidence in herself.

The one thing that can shake her up is the idea of death and loss. Uma has an intense fear of loosing other people, and has a bad habit of either distancing herself from others or clinging to them, at worst acting slightly manipulative to ensure people stay with her.

## Background
Gal'Sha typically aren't human sized. Normally, they're small, roughly football sized creatures with doglike temperment which eat until they reach a certain size, before splitting in two to reproduce. Uma was born with a slight mutation, meaning while she *could* split in two, she didn't feel any compulsion too. Intead, she kept growing until she was able to dedicate enough biomass to thinking that she achieved sentience. This happens time to time with Gal'Sha, but it's rare, and not well understood.
